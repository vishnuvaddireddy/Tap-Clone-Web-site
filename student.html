                        <p>A warm thanks to the <i>Tap Academy team</i>. I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.</p>
                        <p>I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.</p>
                        <p>Finally, I got placed as a <em>Software Engineer</em> at <b>Revature</b> with a package of <b>3.25 LPA</b>. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.</p>

                            I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil Nadu
                            and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other academies,
                            Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, start from scratch,
                            making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for
                            placement opportunities.<br> I'm grateful to have been selected by <b>Avasoft </b>with the role of <em>Trainee Engineer </em>with a package of <b>5 LPA</b>
                            through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the same approach they
                            taught me during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks and study materials,
                            an LMS platform with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing daily programming questions, weekly assessments,
                            and monthly mock assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on logical 
                            thinking.
